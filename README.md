To configure roles you have to be on the admin panel, to go to the admin panel go to the top right and you should be able to switch from "agent panel" to "admin panel". Then to add a new role, you will click on the "agents" tab. Finally click on "roles". You should see a list of roles show up, to add a new role click on "add new role" on the right, it will ask for a name, and to add permissions click on the permissions tab and you can check whatever kind of acces you want to give to the role you created. Once finished click on "add role" and it will show up on the list of roles.

We can do the same with Departments. In the same admin panel if we go to the agents tab and then click on "departments", we can see a list of departments. To add a new department click on "add new department". It will ask for a bunch of settings to fill out for the department you are creating for example Department info, outgoing email and autoresponder settings, and if you click on the access tab you can add agents who will be a part of that department. Once finished filling everything out just click on "create dept".

<p>
To configure teams in the same admin panel we can go to agents and then click on "teams". A list of teams will pop up, and to add a new team click on "add new team". Fill out the information for the new team and you can add agents to the team by clicking on the members tab. Once finished click on "create team" and it will be created.
